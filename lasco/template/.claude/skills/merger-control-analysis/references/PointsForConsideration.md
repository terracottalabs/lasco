- Key risks or considerations
- Recommended timeline

**Approach:**
- Synthesize findings from points 1-13
- Apply classification rules:

  - **Thresholds not met:** Either party clearly below thresholds
  - **To be discussed:** Edge cases, voluntary filing beneficial, data gaps

**Example format:**
```
